## Selected Design: Modern Minimalist with Functional Clarity

I've chosen **Response 1: Modern Minimalist with Functional Clarity** for this PARA website. This approach best serves the educational purpose of the site—it prioritizes clarity and information hierarchy, making it easy for users to understand the PARA method. The Swiss Design influence ensures that every element has a purpose, and the restrained color palette with strategic accents keeps focus on the content while maintaining visual interest.

The deep slate blue conveys professionalism and trust (important for a productivity system), while the vibrant teal accent draws attention to interactive elements and calls-to-action. The asymmetric layouts will create visual interest without overwhelming the user, and the geometric icons will make the four PARA categories instantly recognizable and memorable.
